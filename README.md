# serverless-workflow-to-handle-tickets-in-callcenter
Use AWS Step Functions to design and run a serverless workflow that coordinates multiple AWS Lambda functions. AWS Lambda is a computing service that lets you run code without provisioning or managing servers.
A workflow that describes how you want support tickets to be handled in your call center and a process as a series of discrete tasks that can be repeated again and again. You are able to sit down with the call center manager to talk through best practices for handling support cases. Using the visual workflows in Step Functions as an intuitive reference, you define the workflow together
